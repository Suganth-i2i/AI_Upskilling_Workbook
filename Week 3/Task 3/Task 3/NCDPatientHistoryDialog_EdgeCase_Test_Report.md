## Key Findings
- **Validation logic** is robust against a wide range of malformed, missing, or extreme input values.
- **UI error messages** are shown/hidden correctly in response to user actions and validation results.
- **No crashes** or unhandled exceptions were observed, even with null or unexpected context/data.
- **Prefill logic** gracefully handles incomplete or malformed data.
- **Concurrency and rapid input** do not cause inconsistent validation results.

---

## Recommendations
- Continue to keep validation logic centralized and well-tested.
- Consider trimming whitespace in all user input fields before validation.
- Ensure all error messages are user-friendly and localized.
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage for any future changes to validation or UI logic.

---

## Next Steps
- Integrate these tests into the CI pipeline.
- Review and refactor validation code for maintainability as needed.
- Share this report with the QA and development teams for visibility.
